How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

    
I don't have to look through all the code to find a bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   
I can find where exactly cod was changed and fix a bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
You don't have to fix a bug after every saving. You can save whenever you want and fix all the bug after your commited your changes. 
 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
It's easy to commit all the files you need and then find bugs in all the files, don't wasting your time for each file separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    


I can see where changes were made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

   


I can always back up to the previous version and the program would run as it was before

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
 I'll use it for saving my projects to allow other people to watch them and maybe they'll find something useful there
